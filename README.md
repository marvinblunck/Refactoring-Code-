# Refactoring-Code-

## Description
This challenge was created so that we could see how a onm-the-job-ticket would look like in a workplace enviroment. What we had to do was refactor the code and make it overall more intuitive and readable within the website. We changed HTML elements and combined css terms in order to create code that is not dry.
